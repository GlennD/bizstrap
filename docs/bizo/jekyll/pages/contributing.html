<h3>Background</h3>
<p>
The <code>master</code> branch stays like the upstream Bootstrap master and acts as a vendor branch. The <code>bizo</code> branch contains our changes (bizstrap).
</p>

<p>
E.g. at any time we can <code>git diff origin/master origin/bizo</code> to see what we've changed vs. Bootstrap proper.
</p>

<h3>Making Changes</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Make your changes to the <code>bizo</code> branch, which has our changes</li>
  <li>
  When changing existing Bootstrap files, <strong>make changes inline, and leave a comment with the reason for your change</strong>. This should facilitate merging in changes in the future, as we'll get explicit conflicts (vs. changes in separate files) and also know why we had changed what we did.
  </li>

  <li>
  Sync your changes <code>git push origin bizo</code>
  </li>
  <li>
  Update <code>code.bizo.com/bizstrap</code> (aka this site) by running <code>git push origin bizo:gh-pages</code>.
  </li>
</ol>


<p>This means we don't have to maintain both <code>bizo</code> and <code>gh-pages</code> branches, but satisifies GitHub, which only looks for the <code>gh-pages</code> branch.</p>

<h3>Versioning</h3>
<p>Bizstrap version numbers are <code>bootstrap version.our version</code>.</p>
<p>E.g. <code>2.0.3.1</code> is Bootstrap <code>2.0.3</code>, with our 1st release.</p>


<h3>How to build Bizstrap</h3>
<h4>Dependencies</h4>
