    <p>Action tracking allows you to gain clear visibility into the Bizographic profiles of the audiences who are performing 
    key actions on your site such as "Whitepaper Downloads" or "Event Registrations." Create an action by giving it a name and 
    specifying a <abbr class="initialism">URL</abbr> that marks the completion of the action.</p>
    <p>Action metrics are displayed in your <a href="#">Audience Analysis</a> reports. Once you understand the profiles of 
    your converting audience you can leverage Bizo marketing campaigns to bring more of your target audience to your site.</p>
    <p>Measure how your retargeting campaigns drive conversions on your site by including an action in your <a href="#">Retargeting</a> campaigns.</p>

    <p>Custom audience segments allow you to identify visitors who view specific areas of your site. Once defined, a custom 
    audience segment can be viewed within the <a href="#">Audience Insight</a> report which will display the Bizographic
