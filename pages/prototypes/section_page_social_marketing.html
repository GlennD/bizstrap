    <p>A SmartLink is a shortened URL that packs powerful features. Use it to understand <em>who</em> is clicking
     on your links and engaging with your shared content on all social media platforms. Insert these links in your 
     Tweets, E-mails, blog posts, facebook posts and anywhere else you might share content . The dashboard will 
     show you which of your shares resonated the most with what types of audiences. You can track the impact of 
     your social marketing efforts down to the individual share to drive the best results. </p>

    actions leading to the download confirmation page.</p>
