    <p>A SmartLink is a shortened URL that packs powerful features. Insert these links in your 
     Tweets, E-mails, blog posts, facebook posts and anywhere else you might share content. The Shares/Links report will 
     show you which of your shares resonated the most with your audience. You can track the impact of 
     your social marketing efforts down to the individual share to drive the best results.</p>

    actions leading to the download confirmation page.</p>
