    <p>A SmartLink is a shortened URL that packs powerful features. Insert these links in your 
    Tweets, E-mails, blog posts, facebook posts and anywhere else you might share content. The Shares/Links report will 
    show you which of your shares resonated the most with your audience. You can track the impact of 
    your social marketing efforts down to the individual share to drive the best results.</p>

    <p>Track the performance of each piece of content you share across all channels. Identify which shares resulted in 
    the highest levels of engagement. Use that knowledge to refine your social marketing content strategy.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tagging:</strong> Tags offer a new way to categorize and group together similar shared content and relevant performance data.</li>
      <li><strong>Conversion Tracking:</strong> By tracking <a href="#">actions</a> that visitors complete on your website 
      you'll know which of your shares bring you business. You can see how many 'conversions' resulted from people clicking 
      on your shares. For example, if you want to track how many of your whitepapers get downloaded as a result of a specific 
      share, you may want to create an action that counts visits to the download confirmation page.</li>
