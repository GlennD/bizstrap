  <h1>Design Patterns for Feedback Messaging</h1>
</div>

<p>Defined here are a few of the design patterns for providing feedback messaging in BMP, as well as proposed content.</p>

<h2>Sticky Alert</h2>
<hr />

<p><strong><a href="prototypes/alert-sticky.html" target="_blank">Example Sticky Alert</a></strong></p>

<h3>When to use</h3>
<ul>
  <li>To confirm an action a user has just taken</li>
  <li>To display a limitation that would normally be shown in-line but can't be due to page layout (in a report table, for example)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Specifications</h3>
<p>Use the <code>alert-sticky-backdrop</code>, <code>alert-sticky</code>, and <code>alert-inverse</code> classes as shown below to create an appropriate-looking alert message that's fixed to the top of the viewport. The <code>alert-inverse</code> class was created just for this purpose,
so try not to use the other alert styles with this pattern.</p>
<p>Use CSS transitions to fade the message in, display it for 2 seconds, and then fade it out.</p>
<pre>
&lt;div class="alert-sticky-backdrop"&gt;
  &lt;div class="alert alert-inverse alert-sticky"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;i class="icon-ok icon-white"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Share added to Brand Bar display rotation&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

<h2>Inline Messaging</h2>
<p>BMP supports inline field validation and should validate fields upon completion. See the <a href="forms.html" target="_blank">Forms</a> doc for more info.</p>

<p>Inline messaging may also use the <a href="contextual_help.html" target="_blank">Contextual Help</a> patterns and the standard Bootstrap alert classes depending on the case.</p>
