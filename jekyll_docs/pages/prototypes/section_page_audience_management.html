        <p>Action tracking allows you to gain clear visibility into the Bizographic profiles of the audiences who are performing 
        key actions on your site such as "Whitepaper Downloads" or "Event Registrations." Create an action by giving it a name and 
        specifying a <abbr class="initialism">URL</abbr> that marks the completion of the action.</p>
        <p>Action metrics are displayed in your <a href="section_page_audience_analysis.html">Audience Analysis</a> reports. Once you understand the profiles of 
        your converting audience you can leverage Bizo marketing campaigns to bring more of your target audience to your site.</p>
        <p>Measure how your retargeting campaigns drive conversions on your site by including an action in your <a href="section_page_retargeting.html">Retargeting</a> campaigns.</p>
