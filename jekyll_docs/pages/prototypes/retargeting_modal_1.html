    <h3>Here's what happens next:</h3>
	<ol>
      <li>All ads must be reviewed and approved by Bizo. Until your ad has been approved the campaign will remain in the pending state. New ads are generally approved within 24 hours. We'll notify you if there are any issues with the content of your ads.</li>
      <li>You'll need to <a href="https://platform-dev.bizo.com/app#account">tag your site</a> so we can start building your retargeting audience. Your campaign cannot start until your site is successfully tagged.
    </ol>
    <p>If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact us at <a href="mailto:bizads-support@bizo.com">bizads-support@bizo.com</a>.</p>
